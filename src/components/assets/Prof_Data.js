An invitation to contribute in Annual-Review-of-Fluid-Mechanics is considered a top accolade. Trinity College, the most famous of all Cambridge colleges, awarded him prestigious scholarships. Caius College, Cambridge, made him a Fellow, which gave him the company of international luminaries including Stephen Hawking. von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics invited him for delivering their celebrated lecture series. The distinguished Aerospace Engineering department at Bristol - the city hosting Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Westland-Helicopter - appointed him as a permanent Faculty member. IIT Kharagpur appointed him directly as a Professor.  Examples of appreciation: (i) John Young, the Hopkinson Professor at University of Cambridge, wrote: “due to your research, the world is well under way to a proper understanding of nucleation in turbines after seventy years of abortive attempts!” (ii) The Principal Performance Engineer of Rolls-Royce UK, Konstantinos Kyprianidis, sent email in 2013 to Prof. Guha's IIT address, eulogizing Guha's work. (iii) Guha's papers on gas turbine were taught as part of a 3rd year core course at University of  Bristol. (iv) Guha’s paper on turbulent transport of particles is a compulsory element of a doctoral course at EPFL. (v) Guha made the longest contribution in a 2007 Springer book on shock waves, which is co-authored by a select list of international masters. (vi) Guha's work on shock waves is mentioned 38 times in a 2015 paper of Prof. D.F. Davidson of Stanford University. (vii) At least 30 recent books in different fields cite Guha's work.",

/n/nResearch aspirants who want to question, challenge, learn and ultimately understand how little they (and I) know and how much more is still unknown are warmly welcome to join my group. There are known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  We try to work on problems whose existence are hitherto unknown, i.e. venture (take a leap of faith) into the uncertainty of unknown unknowns.  We take that as challenge and make research an enriching and fun activity, by allowing development of character and abilities to full extent through a friendly and pleasant research environment, helpful peer group and outstanding support network, offered by my vibrant research laboratory.

1.  Smart structures
/n/nProfessor Manas Chandra Ray, a pioneering researcher of smart structures has initiated research on smart composite structures in India, He derived the first bench mark three-dimensional electro-mechanical exact solution of smart composite structures. For efficiently exploiting the vertically reinforced 1-3 piezoelectric composite, he discovered that the transverse actuation by the piezoelectric constraining layer of the active constrained layer damping treatment also causes active damping and active structural-acoustic control of smart structures.
 
/n/n2. Smart materials and nanocomposites
/n/nHis exemplary research revealed that radially grown wavy carbon nanotubes significantly enhance the effective piezoelectric coefficients of the existing 1-3 piezoelectric composite, effective elastic, thermo-elastic and thermal properties of fuzzy fiber-reinforced composite and that flexoelectric fibers can be exploited for developing smart nanocomposite.
 
/n/n3.  Smart nanostructures and strain gradient elasticity
/n/nProf. Ray derived benchmark solution of flexoelectric and flexomagnetic nanostructures and Eshelby tensor employing strain gradient elasticity. He discovered that unlike the elastic solid, the classical stress at a point in a flexoelectric solid due to converse flexoelectricity is affected by the nonlocal elasticity.
 
/n/n4.   Novel Computational models
/n/nA novel computationally efficient three-dimensional fractional order derivative constitutive model of viscoelastic layer is developed by him.
Implementing the hybrid-trefftz finite element method for analyzing laminated structures was a challenging issue for three decades. Recently, Prof. Ray resolved this issue and developed a novel hybrid-trefftz finite element for the analysis of laminated composite/smart structures.
 
/n/n5.   Composite Structures
 
/n/nProf. Ray has a theory entitled “zeroth order shear deformation theory (ZSDT) for laminated composite plates” (ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics, 2003, Vol. 70, No. 3, pp. 374-380) for the analysis of any composite/smart composite structures.
Recently, Prof. Ray solved a breakthrough problem on finding the three-dimensional exact solutions for antisymmetric laminated composite plates which was unsolved for more than 50 years.

/n/nOver the past 5 years, I have developed the Advanced Composites Engineering (ACE) Laboratory at the Training Workshop of Mechanical Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur. The laboratory is now drawing popularity across the globe, owing to the dedication, passion and self-motivation of some of the finest PhD and JRF scholars I have. Nonetheless, the enthusiasm of BTech and MTech students in their term projects is a plus. The laboratory was incepted in a classroom of 70 sqm and has farther expanded to an effective area of 85 sqm. This was not possible without the funding support of IIT Kharagpur, SERB, DRDO, ISRO, and Ministry of Textiles. On behalf of ACE Lab, we invite faculties, researchers and industrialists across the boundaries to visit our lab and try hands-on with fabrication of composites.

        researchStatement: `My research focuses on mitigating the environmental impact of the aviation sector as well as ensuring the safe operation of novel propulsion and battery technologies. Currently, I am actively pursuing the following research problems:
/n/nVortex breakdown phenomenon in swirl-stabilized combustors: A central recirculation zone is used to stabilize the flame in aviation and power gas turbine combustors. Depending on the specific combination of the swirler and combustor, the recirculation zone may be of the open (conical mode) or closed (bubble mode) type. This study will use numerical and experimental tools to study the transition and hysteresis between these modes and their impact on NO emissions from the combustor.
/n/nFlashback phenomenon in high-hydrogen combustors: The risk of flame flashback is aggravated as the hydrogen content in the fuel is increased in a premixed combustor. Characterizing the influence of various input parameters (e.g., swirl and turbulence intensity) on the flashback boundary is essential to ensure the safe operation of the combustor. This study will experimentally and numerically explore how the input parameters influence the flashback boundary in a lean-premixed hydrogen flame.
/n/nInhibition of hydrogen detonation using chemical inhibitors: Detonation is a type of combustion where a reactive front couples with a normal shock, leading to vigorous burning and a large pressure rise. I am investigating the influence of chemical additives that can decouple the shock-flame complex, thus weakening a detonation into a deflagration. This is a numerical study using chemical kinetic tools and commercial CFD software.`,

I am interested in solving challenging problems of fundamental nature.
/n/nMy doctoral research involved the development of a vectorized computer program for solving the three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations using a Fourier-Chebyshev spectral method. The computer code was used to perform direct numerical simulations of instability and transition in mixed convection flows and rotating Taylor-Couette flows, using the CRAY XMP supercomputer at Arizona State University and the CRAY C90 supercomputer at the Pittsburg Supercomputing Center; the results demonstrated the existence of multiple equilibrium states, dependent on initial conditions, and the importance of non-linear interactions in determining the equilibrium state of the flow. My students have been involved in developing accurate numerical methods for simulating two-fluid incompressible flows using level-set methods and solving problems of hydrodynamic stability using Chebyshev collocation methods employing primitive variables on non-staggered grids. The level set method has been used to simulate liquid sloshing. The Chebyshev collocation method has been used to study the stability of buoyancy-driven flows.`,
